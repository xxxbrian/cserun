# CSERun

CSERun is a utility tool designed to assist UNSW CSE students in running course commands such as `autotest` and `give` in their local environment. Powered by Rust, it simplifies the process of executing course-specific commands directly from a local machine.

## Installation

**Homebrew** (recommended way if you are using macOS)

```sh
brew tap xxxbrian/tap
brew install cserun
```

**Cargo**

```sh
cargo install cserun --git https://github.com/xxxbrian/cserun
```

## Configuration and Usage

After installation, navigate to the directory where you wish to run commands:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/work # The directory to run commands in
# Example: cd ~/COMP6991/lab01/exercise01
```

To run a command, use CSERun as follows:

```sh
cserun "your_command_here"
# Example: cserun "6991 autotest"
```

### Configuration Details

After the initial run, CSERun will prompt you to create and modify a TOML configuration file. This file contains essential settings for connecting to the CSE server, including server details and authentication method. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the configuration file and how to customize it:

```sh
# if you forget the configuration file path, you can use the --config option to display it
cserun --config
```

#### Server Configuration

```toml
[server]
addr = "cse.unsw.edu.au" # Default server address, no need to change.
port = 22                # Default port, no need to change.
user = "z5555555"        # Replace "z5555555" with your actual zID.
```

#### Authentication Configuration

You must choose **one** of the three available authentication methods. Each method has its own set of requirements:

##### 1. Password Authentication

If you prefer using a password for authentication, uncomment and fill in the `password` field. If the password is not provided, CSERun will prompt you for it when needed.

```toml
[auth]
type = "password"
password = "your_password" # Optional. Recommended to fill for convenience.
```

##### 2. Key Authentication

For those who use SSH keys, specify the path to your private key. If your key is passphrase-protected, you can also specify the passphrase.

```toml
# [auth]
type = "key"
private_key_path = "/path/to/private/key" # Required for key authentication.
# public_key_path = "/path/to/public/key" # Optional.
# passphrase = "your_passphrase" # Optional.
```

##### 3. Agent Authentication

Agent authentication is useful if you have an SSH agent running that manages your keys.

```toml
# [auth]
type = "agent"
```

**Note:** Remember, these authentication methods are mutually exclusive; only one method should be configured in the file.

#### Completing the Configuration

After choosing and setting up your preferred authentication method, save the changes to the configuration file. Re-run CSERun in your project directory to start using it with the configured settings.

## Advanced Usage

### File ignore

To enhance file synchronization speed with the server, CSERun supports `.gitignore` and `.ignore` files. It will exclude files and directories specified in these files from syncing, which is particularly useful for ignoring project-generated directories like `node_modules` and `target`.

### Arg usage

```sh
cserun [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>
```

#### Arguments

- `<COMMAND>`: The command you wish to run on the CSE server.

#### Options

- `--config`: This option is used independently of others to display the path of the configuration file used by CSERun.

- `--no-sync`: Skip the file synchronization step before running the command. This is useful for commands that do not require the local files, such as `6991 classrun -sturec`.

- `--env <KEY:VALUE>`: Set environment variables for the session in the format of `KEY:VALUE`. You can specify multiple environment variables by repeating the `--env` option with different key-value pairs.

- `-h, --help`: Display a help message with information on CSERun's usage and options.

- `-V, --version`: Print the version of CSERun.

### Examples

To run a command without syncing files and with environment variables set:

```sh
cserun --no-sync --env uni:unsw --env faculty:cse "echo \$uni; echo \$faculty"
```

This example demonstrates how to execute a command that prints out the values of the environment variables `uni` and `faculty`, with those variables set to `unsw` and `cse` respectively, without syncing files to the CSE server before execution.

```sh
cserun --no-sync --env uni:unsw --env faculty:cse "echo \$uni; echo \$faculty"
[1/5] üåê   Connecting to cse.unsw.edu.au:22
[2/5] üîó   Handshake successful
[3/5] üîí   Authenticated as z5555555
[4/5] üö´   Skipped syncing local files
[5/5] ‚ú®   Environment variables set
[5/5] üöÄ   Command sented: echo $uni; echo $faculty
=============== Output ===============
unsw
cse
======================================
Exit status: Success
```
